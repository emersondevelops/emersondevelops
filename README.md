### Hey there! :relaxed:

:man_technologist: I've always liked computers and I've read and followed technological advances since I was a teenager. To start a career in IT seemed to be a natural choice for me. However, I ended up studying Biological Sciences, because understanding about the natural world was another fascination I had. I continued my studies doing a master’s. In it, I took a Biostatistics class, where a professor presented some scripts written in R.

:bar_chart: It was while studying the syntax of that language that I noticed I found it quite easy for me to understand the logic behind that code. By the end of my master’s degree, I started teaching science and biology. However, since that first contact, I was not able to leave programming behind and I started studying other languages, such as Python, Java, and JavaScript.

:notebook: Two years ago I started teaching programming logic to my students in extracurricular classes. And, more recently, I decided to enroll in a computer science graduate course. Therefore, now I intend to change my career to software development.
